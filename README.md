Repo for ARC NCI work on depth resolved connectivity 2026


## Working on ARE (Gadi) — golden loop

All work happens in scratch:
`/scratch/xe19/$USER/depth_connectivity`

Large data and model outputs are NOT tracked by git.

Typical workflow:

```bash
# work in Jupyter / scripts

git status
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe what you did"
git push
